# Multi-View-learning

This is an implementation of diverse machine learning algorithms to enhance the data for multi-view learning. The code is based on the implementation of [1], [2] and [3] the goal is to use these methods over cancer data, using the [Multi-omics Data Integration, Interpretation, and Its Application](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003173/)
[1] Joint nonnegative matrix factorization for multi-view data. 

[2] Similarity network fusion for aggregating data types on a genomic scale.

[3] Kernel K Means Clustering.
