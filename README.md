# Multi-View-learning

This is an implementation of diverse machine learning algorithms to enhance the data for multi-view learning. The code is based on the implementation of [1], [2] and [3] the goal is to use these methods over cancer data, using the [Multi-omics Data Integration, Interpretation, and Its Application](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003173/) paper as a reference.
